This perception can be further compounded by a lack of public recognition or prestige associated with the marine industry, making it less appealing to the youth. Moreover, the marine industry is seen as being less innovative and technologically advanced than other industries, such as tech or healthcare, which are perceived as more exciting and dynamic. This perception can be a barrier to attracting young people with strong technical and innovative skills to the marine industry.\n                        </p>\n                        <p className='mt-3 mb-3'>\n                        We need to shift the narrative and highlight the exciting and rewarding aspects of working in the industry. For instance, the marine industry offers unique opportunities for adventure, travel, and exploration that few other industries can match. Moreover, the industry is increasingly embracing new technologies and innovative practices to enhance efficiency and sustainability, which could appeal to young people with an interest in cutting-edge technology.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                \n            </div>\n            \n        </div>\n        <div
