                <h4>About Us</h4>
                <p className='mb-3'>We are the drivers of technological adoption in the marine industry.</p>
                <p className='mb-3'>SHIPSHAPE.Pro was founded with the vision to provide all stakeholders of the marine industry with their very own online marketplace. At SHIPSHAPE.Pro, whether you are a marine enthusiast, a boat owner, or a professional service provider, you will have access to a multitude of features that will help you make good your course, every time you find yourself in irons. With a single minded focus on marine repairs, we ensure that all boats remain seaworthy at all times, by enabling boat owners to find the right service provider at the opportune time in his/her proximity from our exhaustive panel that includes electricians, engine mechanics, welders, detailers, divers and other general contractors.</p>
                <p className='mb-3'>We understand the exclusivity and the private nature of the marine industry. We also understand the tradition of a heavy dependence on word of mouth for contractor referrals. This is why, for the first time in the history of seafaring, we have brought to the fore prime connectivity features like professional service tagging, precise distance calculators, personalized chat windows, judicious review sections and comprehensive user profiles. SHIPSHAPE.Pro members will have access to our full database of registered boat owners and marine service professionals.</p>
                <p className='mb-3'>SHIPSHAPE.Pro is the brainchild of Merrill Charette and Talha Bhatty, two enterprising liveaboards who have previously established an umbrella company for general marine contracting services—United Marine Systems. Together they also developed a portable, multifunctional utility kit: the Dinghy Thingy, which includes a battery, a bilge pump, a solar charger and speakers among other things—purpose-built to optimize for space on dinghies and subsequently received much recognition at the Newport and Boston boat shows.</p>
                <p className='mb-3'>With a combined 11 years of marine experience, coupled with a cumulative 37 years of business management and digital transformation experience, Merrill and Talha have taken it upon themselves to bring the geographically scattered and digitally challenged marine industry onto a comprehensive online platform and drive it forward, with SHIPSHAPE.Pro.</p>
